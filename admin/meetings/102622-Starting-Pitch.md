**Starting Pitch**
**Medium: Google Slides**
1. ***General Functionalities Ideas- Expense Tracker App***
    * Keep track of our spending 
        * Include spending statistics? (monthly/weekly spending, % money spent on category, etc)
        * How much you’re expected to spend this month based on prior spending habits
    * Categorizes purchases based on user categories
        * There can also be app provided categories to use (groceries, rent, gas, subscription services, fun, etc.)
        * Recurring purchases (income, subscriptions, school fees, etc.)
    * Long-term budgeting
        * Spending/saving goals
        * Split budget between saving, utilities/food, leisure/entertainment
    * Visualizations
        * Bar graphs to show weekly expenses
        * Pie charts- break down spendings by category through percentages
        * Spending last month, last year, entire time on app etc.
    * Introduction for new users
        * Show intro to new users 
2. *** Risks/Rabbit-holes (Javier) *** 
    * Rabbit Holes
        *    Too focused on front end rather than functionality (design choices)
        * Trying to add too many features or getting hung up on particular features (focus on main function which is to keep track of expenses)
        * Taking too much time to learn too many tools to develop app?
        * Might need to research math formulas, math might be confusing.
    * Risks
        * misunderstood interdependencies ( the delays might add up, so we should arrange the deadline leniently 
        * unsolved design problems (hard to implement some essential features in our current framework
        * We may need too many tools to execute what we want to plan/build?
3. ***Visual representation*** of what you are doing in the form of system diagrams and wireframes (does not count towards total page count) ***(Kevin, Ashwin, Andrew Nguyen, Michael)***
    * Figma Mockups
    * Front Page when it appears to new users
    * Front Page when user makes an account
    * Page when user wants to add a new expense
    * Page when user wants visualizations
4. ***Statement of purpose (Abby)***
    * Problem: Overspending/mismanagement of money; Leverage expense tracking to solve the problem of overspending. Really understand where money is coming from and where it is being spent. 
    * Goal: save more money, spend money smarter
5. ***User Personas(Anthony, Andrew Lu)***
    * Children → do we care about this target audience? I doubt they’ll have much money to manage -> thats fair actually. I was thinking of like parents teaching their kids about spending, but i guess thats not too big of a target audience.
    * College students /Teenagers
        * Archetype: Tech Savvy
        * Broke
    * young adults
    * Middle Aged Parents
        * Steady income
        * Many types of expenses
        * Appreciates clearer UI, simple, useful features
    * Old people
    * Sample:
