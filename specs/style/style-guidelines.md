# Team Sleep Deprived Style Guidelines

## General Decisions

- The team consensus is to use tabs instead of spaces. Note that it is common practice in HTML to indent by 2 spaces so we must decide if we wish to do that or use tabs
- If lines end up being very long, they should be wrapped
- Constitent spacing should be used (ex: consistent spacing between functions). VSCode has tools for auto-formatting HTML and JS files (CSS too I think) so this can help us determine spacing conventions

## Naming Conventions

- use descriptiveCamelCase for things like variables. Classes can be named in UpperCamelCase and accessory files and images can be named like: image-file.png or markdown-file.md (file-name.ext)
- **Avoid** acronyms, abbreviations, and odd names
- ***Changing names of files and variables will be very hard to do later on, so we should focus on getting that right now!***


## Other Notes

- Ideally, we will properly break the webapp up into different components and pages. These things should follow a consistent set of naming principles
- ***Consistency is key for all guidelines***. Code should be reviewed by the same set of people to ensure that each file is formatted consistently. Even if the style ends up slightly different from the guidelines in this document, it will be fine as long as the code being committed follows a general set of consistent principles
